# 🎬 Premiere Pro Scripts

A small but mighty toolkit of helpful scripts designed to speed up your workflow and reduce headaches in Adobe Premiere Pro. Each script is built to tackle repetitive tasks and streamline your editing process.

> ⚠️ These scripts require a script runner extension to work inside Premiere Pro.

---

## [Remove Track Section](removeTrackSection.jsx)

Quickly deletes all clips under the playhead—except those on locked tracks—making it easier to clean up staggered or cluttered timelines. Ideal for projects with multiple layers of edits.

---

## [Rename Selected Files](renameSelectedFiles.jsx)

Keep things tidy! This script updates the names of source files to match their names in the Premiere Pro Project panel, helping you stay organized and avoid confusion later.

---

## [Link Lasso](linkLasso.jsx)

Need to batch relink files without digging through folders? Link Lasso helps you reconnect selected files to a new parent directory—no matter how deep or scattered the subfolders are.

---

## [Ditto](ditto.jsx)

Easily copy the source files of your selected clips to a new location. Great for archiving, transferring, or backing up assets.  
> **Tip:** For large files, this might take a bit—perfect time for a coffee break. Want to track progress? Just keep an eye on the destination folder.
